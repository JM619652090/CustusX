Route-to-Target Filter {#org_custusx_filter_airwaysfromcenterline}
===================

\addindex airwaysfromcenterline_filter

Airways-From-Centerline is used in bronchoscopy navigation. It generates artificial airway tubes around the input centerline.
The diameter of the tubes is decided by the generation number (trachea largest). There  is a lower boundary for the tube diameter
making the peripheral airways larger than reality, which makes it possible to virtually navigate inside the tubes.
The airways are generated by creating a volume with tubes around the centerlines and a sphere at each branching point,
to make sure the tubes are fully connected. The output is a surface model generated from the image.

Input:
- Airway centerline tree generated in the \ref org_custusx_filter_airways widget.

Output:
- Airway tube surface model
- A smoothed version of the input centerline used to generate the tubes
