Route-to-Target Filter {#org_custusx_filter_airwaysfromcenterline}
===================

\addindex airwaysfromcenterline_filter

Airways-From-Centerline is used in bronchoscopy navigation. It makes artificial airway tubes around the input centerline.
The diameter of the tubes is decided by the generation number (trachea largest). There  is a lower boundary for the
tube diameter making the peripheral airways larger than in reality, which makes it possible to virtually navigate inside
the tubes. The airways are generated by adding a sphere to a volume (image) at each point along every branch.
The output is a surface model generated from the volume.

Input:
- Airway centerline tree generated in the \ref org_custusx_filter_airways widget.

Output:
- Airway tube surface model
- A smoothed version of the input centerline used to generate the tubes
