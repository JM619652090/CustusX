/**
 * \brief Display overlayed image slices in 2D.
 *
 * The functionality is similar to SlicerRepSW, but the actual slicing
 * is performed by loading the image into the GPU as a 3D texture and
 * slicing it there, using the GPU.
 *
 * Several images are sliced simultaneously, and are overlayed using the
 * alpha transfer function (it is assumed to be a step function).
 *
 *
 *
 * The Texture3DSlicerRep draws several image slices in an overlay.
 * Opacity and LLR are used to draw several images on top of each other.
 * Despite its name is this a 2D Rep (it is drawn in a plane).
 *
 * The Texture3DSlicerRep class itself does very little real work:
 * It inherits from RepImpl and Rep, thus it can be added to a View.
 * The drawing functionality is embedded in Texture3DSlicerProxy, while
 * the slicer functionality is embedded in SliceProxy.
 *
 * SliceProxy determines the slice matrix and viewport from a Tool and
 * the slice definition (fex Axial, Sagittal, etc.). It uses a SliceComputer
 * to do the math. Texture3DSlicerProxy is a base class with default dummy
 * behaviour. This is solely a hack to get the code to compile on Windows.
 * The real behaviour lie in  Texture3DSlicerProxyImpl. It assembles images
 * and a slice definition, which is sent to the TextureSlicePainter to be
 * renderered. Most of the actual OpenGL code in embedded inside
 * TextureSlicePainter.
