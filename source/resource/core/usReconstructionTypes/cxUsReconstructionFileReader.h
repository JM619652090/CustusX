/** \brief Reader class for the US Acquisition files.
 *
 * \sa UsReconstructionFileMaker
 *
 * \section us_acq_file_format_description Format description
 *
 * All files describing one acquisition lie the same folder.  The files all have
 * the name format US-Acq_\<index\>\_\<TS\>\<stream\>.\<type\>",
 * where
 *  - \<index\> is a running index, for convenience.
 *  - \<TS\> is a timestamp
 *  - \<stream\> is the uid of the video stream. Not used prior to cx3.5.0.
 *  - \<type\> is the format of that specific file.
 *
 * Together, the files contains information about the us images and their
 * timestamps, the tracking positions and their timestamps, and the probe
 * calibration.
 *
 * In the following, we use \<filebase\> = US-Acq_\<index\>_\<TS\>\<stream\>.
 *
 *
 * \subsection us_acq_file_format_mhd \<filebase\>.mhd (obsolete)
 *
 * Used prior to version cx3.4.0.
 * A file in the metaheader file format containing the uncompressed image data.
 * the z-direction is the time axis, i.e. the z dim is the number of us frames.
 * See http://www.itk.org/Wiki/MetaIO/Documentation for more.
 *
 * Two extra tags are added:
 *
 * \verbatim
ConfigurationID = <path:inside:ProbeCalibConfigs.xml>
ProbeCalibration = <not used>
\endverbatim
 *
 * The ConfigurationID refers to a specific configuration within
 * ProbeCalibConfigs.xml, using colon separators.
 *
 * \subsection us_acq_file_format_mhd_indexed \<filebase\>_\<index\>.mhd
 *
 * A sequence of files in the metaheader file format containing the image data, one file
 * for each frame. The frame index is given by the index in the file name.
 * See http://www.itk.org/Wiki/MetaIO/Documentation for more.
 * Replaces ref us_acq_file_format_mhd .
 *
 * \subsection us_acq_file_format_file_xml ProbeCalibConfigs.xml (obsolete)
 *
 * This file contains the probe definition, and is copied from the
 * config/tool/Tools folder.
 *
 * \subsection us_acq_file_format_file_probedata \<filebase\>.probedata.xml
 *
 * This file contains the probe definition. Replaces ref us_acq_file_format_file_xml .
 *
 * \subsection us_acq_file_format_file_fts \<filebase\>.fts
 *
 * This file contains the frame timestamps. This is a sequence of
 * newline-separated floating-point numbers in milliceconds. The starting point
 * is irrelevant. The number of timestamps must equal the number of us frames.
 *
 *
 * \subsection us_acq_file_format_tp \<filebase\>.tp
 *
 * This file contains the tracking positions. This is a newline-separated
 * sequence of matrices, one for each tracking sample. Each matrix is the prMt,
 * i.e. the transform from tool to patient reference (See \ref coordinate_systems ).
 * The last line of the matrix (always containing 0 0 0 1) is omitted. The matrix
 * numbers is whitespace-separated with newline between rows. Thus the number of
 * lines in this file is (# tracking positions) x 3.
 *
 *
 * \subsection us_acq_file_format_tts \<filebase\>.tts
 *
 * This file contains the tracking timestamps. The format equals \ref us_acq_file_format_file_fts ,
 * but the number of timestamps equals the number of tracking positions.
 *
 * \subsection us_acq_file_format_fp \<filebase\>.fp
 *
 * This file contains the frame positions. This is a newline-separated
 * sequence of matrices, one for each US frame. Each matrix is the rMu,
 * i.e. the transform from lower-left centered image space to
 * global reference (See \ref coordinate_systems and \ref ProbeDefinition).
 * The last line of the matrix (always containing 0 0 0 1) is omitted. The matrix
 * numbers is whitespace-separated with newline between rows. Thus the number of
 * lines in this file is (# tracking positions) x 3.
 *
 * \subsection us_acq_file_format_mask \<filebase\>.mask.mhd
 *
 * This file contains the image mask. The binary image shows what parts
 * of the frame images contain valid US data. This file is only written,
 * not read. It can be constructed from the probe data.
 *
